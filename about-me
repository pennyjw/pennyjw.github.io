I work in academic development, with all the different project work that involves. I teach a unit in technology-enhanced learning in higher education to my colleagues via our Graduate Certificate in Higher Education; I have also taught higher education policy, and facilitated induction for new academics and training in the LMS (once Blackboard, currently Moodle).  I am a graduate of the University of Sydney, where I tutored in English literature, language and linguistics; of the University of Technology, Sydney, where I completed a Masters in eLearning; and Macquarie University, where I completed a Masters of Research in linguistics and material culture. I have also taught in the vocational education and community education sectors.

Because of my background in Linguistics, I have worked on programs for the university on English language development in the curriculum, and have assisted my colleagues in projects on assessment, first-in-family students, lecture capture and core curriculum.  of experience in public communication and workplace training, having worked as a government publisher and manager for agricultural and environmental communication campaigns.
